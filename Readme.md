This product is aimed at improving the viewing experience in Valorant by providing data that can be used to create a custom HUD that can be integrated to a live broadcast.

It is using computer vision to gather information on the game (hp of the players, round time, and scores).

Only a bandaid until Riot releases a better way to do this (local telemetry data, game API, spectator API...)

## Example
